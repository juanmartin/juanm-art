I usually play with perspectives. How we see and perceive our world has always been a subject of analysis for me. I have "voluntary" [strabismus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strabismus) meaning I can control it, this allows some crazy perspectives. Playing with my eyes as a kid showed me a hidden world. Create a view in which you consider the image in your brain as two-dimensional, therefore objects that are further away can collide with those that are close.

Made this with the help of my genius friend who I admire **a lot**, [@rolodato](https://github.com/rolodato).

import { FaAdn } from "react-icons/fa"

YAS!
I added MDX support following [this tutorial](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/blog/2019-11-21-how-to-convert-an-existing-gatsby-blog-to-use-mdx/).

```js
// you can write JSX in your Markdown!
<button>test</button>
```

<button>test</button>

Thanks to VSCode I was able to quickly find and replace everything from `mardownRemark` to `mdx` plugin.
Now I'm able to combine JSX within my new MDX files! Cool huh!? I'll better do some trippy shit now.

## WORK

I am a freelance tech tinkerer / software dev. I create **"tech solutions"**. They mainly involve programming, and sometimes also some hardware installation. I do my research, learn whatever tools are needed and choose those **optimal** for the job. This includes cloud services, IoT, deployment of custom software for specific needs (native apps in Electron and React Native), NodeJS microservices, web development using CMS for eCommerce, interactive web apps using React, and a lot more.

Lately I have been making lots of webapps for interactive museum exhibitions, and remote control webapps for hardware installations to control lights, other apps, motors, sensors, etc.

I enjoy working with systems, ssh'ing to servers, automating stuff, configuring Raspberry Pi's, syncing MIDI instruments, deploying a big soundsystem and playing music on it, using some Arduino's[^1] to create stuff with motors, lights and controlling them with some sensors, projecting generative visuals for live performances, you name it, I'll do it with a smile on my face =)

I worked @ [Raven](https://www.raven.com) as a frontend developer from June 2021 to July 2022. We made document scanners. It was great, people were lovely and helpful. I mainly used Electron which I had experience with and Angular which I was new at, but coming from React I got the idea quickly and enjoyed some of it very much, mainly the fact that it's TypeScript native <3. I also did some low level work with C++ for the scanner firmware and drivers working closely with the Taiwanese manufacturers. I learned a lot about how to work in a team (async), how to communicate with people from different backgrounds and enjoyed writing/documenting a lot.

Before, I used to work as a **graphic designer** since 2011 as my family had a small [communication company](https://www.landgraphic.com). Learned the Adobe pack really well, specially Illustrator and InDesign, and of course Photoshop. Mainly printed stuff. It was fun! and also interesting to analyse the resources for design tendencies throughout the years. It really helped me to learn how to visually communicate ideas.

I still help with some artworks now and then but the pandemic really messed their line of work (mainly events, which were, of course, cancelled).

I worked from mid 2014 to early 2019 in a [research team](https://www.intercambiostransorganicos.org) at [MUNTREF](http://untref.edu.ar/muntref/es/arte-y-ciencia/) with university mates (now beloved friends <3). It's quite interesting, you should check it. Collaboration is key to have impact.

In 2013 I decided I wanted to explore the artistic road, so I went from engineering to arts with a twist, a _techie_ twist, and my mom found there was an Electronic Arts degree at UNTREF (carrera de grado, not sure about academic degree translations), and went right in! thx mom I love u.

import { FaBeer } from "react-icons/fa"

YAS!
I added MDX support following [this tutorial](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/blog/2019-11-21-how-to-convert-an-existing-gatsby-blog-to-use-mdx/).

```js
// you can write JSX in your Markdown! The following button is this
<button className="bg-blue-500 hover:bg-blue-700 text-white font-bold py-2 px-4 rounded mt-5 mb-5">test</button>
```

<button className="bg-blue-500 hover:bg-blue-700 text-white font-bold py-2 px-4 rounded mt-5 mb-5">test</button>

I'm using [Tailwind](https://tailwindcss.com/) btw, discovered it with this Gatsby starter. Looks like inline styling... but it's not.

Thanks to VSCode I was able to quickly find and replace everything from `mardownRemark` to `mdx` plugin.
Now I'm able to combine JSX within my new MDX files! Cool huh!? I'll better do some trippy shit now.
